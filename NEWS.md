# ecic 0.0.4

## version 0.0.4
- Minor changes and bug fixes for CRAN.

## version 0.0.3

### New Features
- Added progress bars to the bootstrap procedure with the `progress_bar` option.
- writing the bootstrap results to temporary files with `save_to_temp` is now also possible in parallel computing.
- Computation can now be sped up by rounding the dependent variable before imputation. This reduces precision but leads to gains in running time.
- `summary` and `print` now use the generic functions.

### Bug Fixes
- bugs in processing the inputs in `ecic_plot` fixed.
- Bugs in resampling for the weighted bootstrap fixed.
- Various additional input-checks added.
