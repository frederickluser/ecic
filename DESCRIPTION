Description: Functions for implementing extended changes-in-changes models
    a la Susan Athey and Guido Imbens (2006) with multiple cohorts and
    time periods. Computes quantile treatment effects for all possible
    two-by-two combinations (by aggregating the CDFs and inverting the
    quantile functions). Then summarizes or plots the treatment effects.
